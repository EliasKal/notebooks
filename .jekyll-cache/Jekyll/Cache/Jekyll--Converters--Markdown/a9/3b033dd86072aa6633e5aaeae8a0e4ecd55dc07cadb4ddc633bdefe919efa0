I"<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. ‘Tis some visitor I muttered, rapping at my chamber door; only this and nothing more \(a = b_2\).</p>

\[a = b + 2\]

<p>Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December, and each separate dying ember rought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had tried to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow; sorrow for the lost Lenore. For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore. Nameless here for evermore.</p>

<p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before. So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating: ‘Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door. Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door. This is it and nothing more!</p>
