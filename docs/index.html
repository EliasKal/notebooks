		<h1>Notebooks</h1>
<h3>by Elias Kalamaras</h3>

The following are personal notes about various subjects of interest to me. This site was inspired by <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles"/>Matt Might's blog</a> and <a href="https://www.refsmmat.com/notebooks/">Alex Reinhart's notebooks</a>. If you find some of these notes interesting too, that would be great.

			<p>I have been using <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> as a text editor for some time now and today I had a moment of delight when I finally started to understand its power. I managed to perform a tedious task effectively using Vim macros and registers!</p>

			<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. â€˜Tis some visitor I muttered, rapping at my chamber door; only this and nothing more \(a = b_2\).</p>

		<li>
			<p>
				<a href="/notebooks/2016/04/24/about_minus_one_twelfth.html">About -1/12</a>,
				24 Apr, 2016
			</p>
			
			<p>These notes are about the famous and odd result that the sum of all natural numbers is \(-1/12\):</p>
