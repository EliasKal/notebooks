<h1>Notebooks</h1>
<h3>by Elias Kalamaras</h3>

The following are personal notes about various subjects of interest to me, such as statistics and probability. This site was inspired by <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles"/>Matt Might's blog</a> and <a href="https://www.refsmmat.com/notebooks/">Alex Reinhart's notebooks</a>; its purpose is first to just write down a few thoughts about some subject I was interested at some time, so as not to forget them. If you find some of these notes interesting too, that would be great.

<ul>
	{% for post in site.posts %}

				{{ post.date | date: "%d %b, %Y" }}
			</p>
			{% comment %} {{ post.excerpt }} {% endcomment %}
		</li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
