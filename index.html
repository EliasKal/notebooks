<h1>Notebooks</h1>
<h3>by Elias Kalamaras</h3>

The following are personal notes about various subjects of interest to me. This site was inspired by <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles"/>Matt Might's blog</a> and <a href="https://www.refsmmat.com/notebooks/">Alex Reinhart's notebooks</a>. If you find some of these notes interesting too, that would be great.

<ul>
	{% for post in site.posts %}
		<li>
			<p>
				<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>,
				{{ post.date | date: "%d %b, %Y" }}
			</p>
			{% comment %} {{ post.excerpt }} {% endcomment %}
			{{ post.excerpt }}
		</li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
